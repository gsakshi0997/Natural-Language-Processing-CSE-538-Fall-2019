My model is based on the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.07333.pdf
It consists of 2 Convolution Layers with different filter numbers that
I tried. It also has 2 maxpool layers with pool size equal to the
maximum sentence length and also a dropout layer.

The above is an image of the basic architecture of my model. If
it is not visible then I have attached it in the report.pdf also.
I have also explained the flow of my system in the report.
